Wireless-Project 
===================================================

This project is designed to setup a spontaneous network, to measure link qualities, to integrate
physical environments with communication networks, to use protocols, and finally, to observe the
impact of networking architecture and protocols on system performance. The overal objective of this
project is to find the speed (or delay) of "help" message dissemination in a Vehicle-to-Vehicle
network in a real city. That is, a "help" message will be generatd by one car and  will be
broadcasted to other cars.
